## Description about Project
This project was done and presented in December 2023. this is my first experience to make an analysis of a dataset. this analysis is done using spreadsheets and tableau as tools for visualization and is still far from a perfect analysis. This project is about analyzing the learning patterns of class users on the MasaDepan.Ku platform to find out and provide recommendations for what fields of study on the MasaDepan.Ku platform need improvement based on ratings, program completion rates by users and review assistance provided by users. in addition, several other analyses were also carried out to assist stakeholders in making decisions such as analyzing the number of registrants each year, the average age of users of each study program, or the number of participation based on gender for each field of study.
